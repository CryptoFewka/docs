### Installation

To get started, make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You
can do this by running the following command:

```
yarn
```

### Local Development

For local development, you can run a development server by executing the
following command:

```
yarn dev
```

This will start a local development server and automatically open a browser
window. Most changes you make will be reflected live without the need to restart
the server.

### Build

To generate static content for deployment, you can use the following command:

```
yarn build
```

Running this command will generate the static content and store it in the build
directory. You can then use any static content hosting service to serve the
documentation.

We encourage and welcome contributions to the ZetaChain documentation. If you
have any suggestions, improvements, or find any issues, please feel free to
contribute by submitting a pull request.
