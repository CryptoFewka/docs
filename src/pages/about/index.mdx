# What is ZetaChain?

ZetaChain is the foundational, public blockchain that enables omnichain smart
contracts and messaging between any blockchain. It solves the problems of
"cross-chain" and "multi-chain" and aims to open the crypto and global financial
ecosystem to anyone.

ZetaChain envisions and supports a truly fluid, multi-chain crypto ecosystem,
where users and developers can move between and appreciate the benefits of any
blockchain: payments, DeFi, liquidity, games, art, social graphs, performance,
security, privacy, and more.

## Key Features

### Chain Abstraction Framework

ZetaChain is a decentralized and public blockchain network. Built on Cosmos SDK
and Comet BFT consensus, ZetaChain's Chain Abstraction Framework (CAF) enables
omnichain connectivity. It offers the ability to build robust state management
with multi-leg, multi-chain apps, using the familiar EVM development
environment.

### Hyper-connected Nodes

ZetaChain's nodes can read and write to connected chains through its TSS
architecture, enabling a secure, decentralized Chain Abstraction Framework for
cross-chain applications.

### Omnichain Smart Contracts

Smart contracts deployed on ZetaChain can read/write to connected chains.
ZetaChain is the only public blockchain supporting smart contracts with this
capability.

### Cross-chain Message Passing

Developers can pass messages between chains with simple function calls. This
enables cross-chain transactions and asset movements in one step.

### Managed External Assets

ZetaChain can manage assets and vaults on externally connected chains, enabling
orchestration and smart contract logic across chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

## Technical Roadmap

ZetaChainâ€™s mission is to serve as a platform for universal access, simplicity,
and utility across any blockchains. The initial mainnet launch contains all core
functionalities, including the EVM layer, omnichain smart contracts, and
cross-chain messaging.

This roadmap outlines potential development directions to improve and expand
upon ZetaChain's functionality based on community input. Upgrades will be done
through governance, and the development of ZetaChain is fully open-source.

## Roadmap Pillars

### Pillar 1: Chain Integrations

**Objective:** Expand the ecosystem by integrating additional blockchain
networks like Solana, Filecoin, and Cosmos ecosystem.  
**Expected Outcome:** Increased network robustness and accessibility.

### Pillar 2: More dApp, Asset, and Transaction Types

**Objective:** Facilitate the creation of diverse decentralized applications
(dApps) and assets.  
**Key Features:** Support for ZRC-20, NFT, and BRC20/Ordinals in omnichain smart
contracts.  
**Expected Outcome:** A more vibrant ecosystem supporting a wider range of
applications.

### Pillar 3: Trust Model Improvement & Security

**Objective:** Enhance the trust model and security of the network.  
**Strategies:** Shift from observation to proof-verification and improve
observer/tss signer monitoring.  
**Expected Outcome:** Reduced costs and increased network security.

### Pillar 4: Performance and Robustness Improvement

**Objective:** Boost the network's efficiency and throughput.  
**Key Areas:** Higher cross-chain TPS, lower resource consumption, and improved
error handling.

### Pillar 5: Omnichain dApp Developer Tooling, SDK, and Support

**Objective:** Provide superior tools and support to developers.  
**Tools to Develop:** SDKs, debugging tools, and cross-chain transaction
simulation.

### Pillar 6: Taking Ownership of Key Dependencies

**Objective:** Improve key open-source dependencies like Ethermint and TSS-lib.  
**Expected Outcome:** A more reliable ecosystem with smoother integration.
